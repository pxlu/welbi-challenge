# Create a single (1) system that will recommend programs to be run. It should propose three candidate programs which address one of the following needs:

- Something that Darla Blanda would like
- Engages the highest number of residents
- Engages multiple isolated residents (those who have not been to a program recently)
- Addresses a gap in offerings (lots of interest from residents, but no similar programs planned)
- Addresses a gap in time (a reasonable day and time with few programs offered)

This system can be interacted via the CLI, a Rest/tRPC endpoint, a GraphQL mutation, have a frontend attached to it or anything else of your liking.
